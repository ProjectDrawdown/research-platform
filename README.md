# Drawdown Research Platform

Welcome to the codebase for the online Drawdown Research Platform.

This site uses the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage content that is stored in this repository.

To get the site and CMS running locally, just follow these steps:

1. [Install NodeJS and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your system, if you haven't already. 
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the site's files locally.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the webserver.
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the site, or `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html` to access the admin panel.
6. When trying to log in to the admin panel, you may need to create an account via email and password at the Netlify App domain: `https://modest-roentgen-e63e0e.netlify.app/admin/index.html`. Once you've confirmed your account via email, you should be able to log in with the same credentials locally.

Enjoy!
